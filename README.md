# flexed - The Flexible WYSIWYG Editor

This project is an attempt to create a flexible WYSIWYG editor of anything.
Currently includes basic pack based on the Rich Text Format.

Depends on jQuery, [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com) and [rangy](http://code.google.com/p/rangy).

## Contributing

The project is at it's very beginning, but you may join and create a "suite" for your
favorite markup language (e. g. Markdown).

## License

MIT, basically. Just do whatever you want but keep my name in code.
